    <abstract>
      <t>Describes limitations of the existing range of dynamic IPv6 multicast addresses specified in RFC3307. Recommends replacing these allocations with a new registry in the IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry registry group. Suggests initial contents of the new registry: a reduced allocation for MADCAP (RFC2730), a Private Use range, and Solicited-Node multicast addresses (which were not previously noted in RFC3307).</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>For IPv6 multicast addresses, <xref target="RFC3307" sectionFormat="of" section="2"/> defines the lower 32 bits of the IPv6 address, which are mapped directly to the link-layer, as the group ID, and then assigns ranges of group ID values based on how they are allocated. Section <xref target="RFC3307" sectionFormat="bare" section="4.3"/> describes dynamic assignment of group ID values and lists two different approaches (server allocation and host allocation). However, both approaches are assigned the same range of group ID values, which means they cannot coexist without risking an address collision. Also concerning is that the range for dynamic assignment overlaps with the range used for Solicited-Node multicast addresses (see <xref target="RFC4291" sectionFormat="of" section="2.7.1"/>).</t>

      <t>Only one server allocation protocol has been defined so far (see <xref target="RFC2730"/>), but <xref target="I-D.ietf-pim-zeroconf-mcast-addr-alloc-ps"/> advocates developing a decentralized, zero-configuration host allocation protocol. This document updates the dynamic IPv6 multicast group ID ranges to better align with current practices for protocol number assignment and to support development of additional dynamic allocation protocols.</t>

    <section title="Updated Dynamic Multicast Group IDs">
      <t>Existing group ID allocations specified in <xref target="RFC3307" sectionFormat="comma" section="4.3"/> and <xref target="RFC4291" sectionFormat="comma" section="2.7.1"/> are summarized in the following table:</t>

      <table>
        <name>Existing Allocations</name>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><br/><br/><tt>0x80000000</tt>-<tt>0xFEFFFFFF</tt><br/><br/><br/></td>
            <td><!--Empty--></td>
            <td rowspan="2"><br/><br/>Server allocation (MADCAP)</td>
            <td rowspan="2"><br/><br/>Host allocation</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>0xFF000000</tt>-<tt>0xFFFFFFFF</tt></td>
            <td>Solicited-Node</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <t>This document updates the allocations in <xref target="RFC3307" sectionFormat="comma" section="4.3"/> and moves them into a new registry in the IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry registry group. The registry shall be populated with the following entries:</t>

      <table anchor="groupIDs">
        <name>Updated Allocations</name>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Range</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Reference</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>0x80000000</tt>-<tt>0x8FFFFFFF</tt></td>
            <td>MADCAP</td>
            <td><xref target="RFC2730"/></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>0x90000000</tt>-<tt>0xFDFFFFFF</tt></td>
            <td>Unassigned</td>
            <td><!--Empty--></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>0xFE000000</tt>-<tt>0xFEFFFFFF</tt></td>
            <td>Private Use</td>
            <td><!--TODO: Replace with this document-->[This document]</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><tt>0xFF000000</tt>-<tt>0xFFFFFFFF</tt></td>
            <td>Solicited-Node multicast addresses</td>
            <td><xref target="RFC4291" sectionFormat="comma" section="2.7.1"/></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <t>This reduces the range previously available for MADCAP, while still providing a sizable allocation. It also allocates a Private Use range, which can be used in isolated deployments for purposes such as manual address allocation or experimentation with new dynamic allocation protocols. Finally, this documents the range used for Solicited-Node multicast addresses. All remaining entries are reserved for future assignment as new protocols are developed.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document does not expand on any security considerations beyond what is discussed in <xref target="RFC3307"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA should create a new registry named "Dynamic Multicast Group IDs" in the "IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry" registry group. This registry shall initially contain the entries listed in <xref target="groupIDs"/>. The "Standards Action" registration policy is required to update the registry.</t>

      <t>IANA should also update the references to "<tt>FF3X:0:0:0:0:0:8000:0-FF3X:0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:FFFF</tt>" in the "Unicast-based (Including SSM) Multicast Group IDs" registry in the "IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry" registry group. The registration procedure should indicate that this range uses dynamic assignment according to the protocols listed in the new "Dynamic Multicast Group IDs" registry and include a reference to this document. The description in the registry entry should indicate that this range uses dynamic assignment according to the protocols listed in the new "Dynamic Multicast Group IDs" registry and the reference should be changed to this document.</t>
